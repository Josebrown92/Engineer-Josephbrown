Purpose

 This is a clean, responsive portfolio to showcase my best work, communicate my services/skills, and convert visitors into clients or collaborators. Primary goal: make it easy for visitors to see your work and contact you.

Pages (3–5)

Home — elevator pitch, featured project(s), main CTAs.

About — short bio, skills, timeline, downloadable résumé.

Portfolio / Gallery — project grid with filters; each project links to a project detail page.

Services — what you offer, process, pricing or packages (optional).

Contact — contact form, social links, quick contact info, optional calendar booking link.

Page layouts (sketch / block order)

Each page shares a common header & footer for consistent navigation.

Home (structure)

Header: logo (left), nav (right), CTA button “Hire / Contact”

Hero: short headline (1 line), 1–2-sentence subhead, primary CTA (View work / Contact), hero image or subtle animation

Featured Projects: 3 highlighted projects (cards) with thumbnails + one-line outcome

Services preview: 2–3 core services (icons + short text)

Testimonials / Social proof (2–3 quotes or logos)

Footer: contact summary, links, copyright, social icons

User journeys (3 short scenarios)

Potential client (quick) — lands on Home → views Featured Projects → goes to Project Detail → clicks Contact → fills form.
Design implication: prominent project outcomes, visible contact CTA.

Recruiter (detail-oriented) — About → Skills/Resume download → Portfolio (filters) → LinkedIn / Contact.
Design implication: clear résumé link; structured skills + metrics.

Curious visitor — Home → Services → case studies → newsletter signup.
Design implication: light friction, helpful microcopy.

Content & project case study structure

For each project case study include:

One-line summary (role + outcome).

Problem/brief.

Solution (your work + tech).

Key results (quantified if possible).

Links/images and CTA.

Recommended: 6–12 project cards; highlight 3 as “featured” on home.

Wireframe & responsive behavior (practical)

Grid: 12-column for desktop; card grid collapses to 1 column on small screens.

Header: sticky with compact state after scroll.

Breakpoints: mobile (≤640px), tablet (641–1024px), desktop (≥1025px).

Mobile nav: hamburger → slide-down menu.

Images: use srcset, lazy-load, WebP where possible.

SEO, accessibility & performance (quick checklist)

Title, meta description per page; Open Graph tags for social sharing.

Semantic HTML (<header>, <main>, <nav>, <article>, <footer>).

Alt text for all images; meaningful link text; keyboard focus states; aria-* where needed.

Fast performance: compress images, minify CSS/JS, use critical CSS, defer nonessential JS.

Form spam: simple CAPTCHA or honeypot field.

Analytics: add GA4 or privacy-friendly Plausible; consider consent banner.

Visual / content tone & CTAs

Tone: concise, confident, benefit-driven.

Primary CTAs: “Hire me / Contact” and “View work.” Secondary: “Download résumé,” “Book consult.”

Microcopy: set expectations—“I reply within 48 hours” (only if true).

Technical notes & deliverables

Tech stack options: static HTML/CSS/JS (fast + simple), or static-site generator (Hugo/Eleventy) if you want templating.

Optional: project CMS for easy updates (Netlify CMS, Sanity, or even Notion → public).

Deliverables I can produce now if you want: folder with index.html, about.html, portfolio.html, styles.css, script.js, plus one sample project detail and a README.md.

Next steps (pick one)

I can generate the starter files (HTML/CSS/JS) — ready to copy into your project.

Or I can create a single-page wireframe mockup (text-based) or a README style spec you can hand to a dev/designer.
